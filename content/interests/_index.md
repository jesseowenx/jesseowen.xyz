## Tech
I am a technologist by trade so I spend a great deal of my spare time tinkering with various tech-related things

- Coding/Programming
- DIY Projects (blog post coming soon)
- System Administration (background in various IT roles)
- Site Reliability Engineering (currently working as an SRE)
- DevOps
- Cloud

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and over 6 years of expierence in the tech industry.
