## Old School RuneScape

I play Old School Runescape infrequently. I have had many accounts over the years but these two what I play most
- [jesselol (main)](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/hiscorepersonal?user1=jesselol)
- [jessemofo (Iron Man - formerly HC)](https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/hiscorepersonal?user1=jessemofo)

I kind of lost interest of Iron Man after dying on my HCIM. I was gearing up to get a fire cape and I just got RCB from crazy archaeologist and managed to survive the wildy the entire time & successfully fought off pkers. Then straight after I forgot to bring an anti-dragon shield to a steel dragons tasks like an idiot.
