## Android Permission Attestator

For my final year capstone project I collaborated in a team to build a Kotlin-based Android application.

The application is designed to help users manage and understand the permissions requested by their installed apps. It provides a comprehensive overview of all permissions, categorizing them based on their potential risks and implications for user privacy and security.

Due to stakeholder requirements the repository has to remain private but it is published and publicly available on the Google Play Store.

## Galaga Remake
A remake of the classic arcade game Galaga, built with Unity!

This project uses custom 2D sprites and features unique movement controls. The controls include WASD for movement and left mouse click to shoot. I implemented key mechanics like player movement, shooting, scoring, and more using **C#**.

You can check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jesseowenx/galaga-remake)

I will compile a build at some stage and maybe port it to run as a web app for demonstration.
