## Android Permission Attestator

For my final year capstone project I collaborated in a team to build a Kotlin-based Android application.

The application is designed to help users manage and understand the permissions requested by their installed apps. It provides a comprehensive overview of all permissions, categorizing them based on their potential risks and implications for user privacy and security.

Due to stakeholder requirements the repository has to remain private but it is published and publicly available on the Google Play Store.
