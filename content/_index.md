## About

I am Jesse and this is my webpage. This is where I showcase some of my work, share my thoughts on various topics and also provide updates on what I am upto. The purpose of this webpage's existence is to compile all of my stuff into a single location.

I am a technologist by trade so I spend a great deal of my spare time tinkering with various tech-related things such as:

- Coding/Programming
- Cloud infrastructure
- DevOps tools & practices
- Hardware - homelab and IoT projects

I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and over 6 years of expierence in the tech industry. I have a background in various tech roles and I am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer.
